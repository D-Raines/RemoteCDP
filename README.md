## RemoteCDP
RemoteCDP is a Docker container designed to run on a VPS with a dedicated IP address. It sets up Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) behind a Squid reverse proxy, enabling remote access to a headless Chrome browser instance from outside the container. This allows remote code execution for tasks such as web testing and scraping.

By routing CDP traffic through Squidâ€™s reverse proxy and leveraging its caching features, RemoteCDP reduces duplicate page downloads across the network, improving efficiency. This setup is intended to be deployed on a VPS, where the Docker container runs continuously to provide a stable, remotely accessible browser environment for an LLM agent or other automation scripts.
